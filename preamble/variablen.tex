\newcommand{\zusammenfassung}{The aim of this master's thesis is to design and evaluate a strategy for the migration of an existing \ac{EA} into a cloud environment. Furthermore, it identifies changes and tools which are necessary to take full advantage of cloud computing. Also commonly used migration strategies are compared with each other in order to design the most suitable cloud migration strategy for \acp{EA}. For the sake of evaluation, an existing application was migrated both to an Infrastructure as a Service and a Platform as a Service cloud model for identifying which offers more benefits. The application was also compared with and partly migrated to a cloud native approach for revealing required adjustments within the cloud computing. Apart from a well designed migration strategy, the outcome of this thesis are findings on different cloud approaches that can be used to successfully migrate an existing \ac{EA} into a cloud environment. Therefore, a migration to a Platform as a Service model using a cloud native approach, has several advantages such as increasing scalability, higher availability and an improvement of the development pace.}
